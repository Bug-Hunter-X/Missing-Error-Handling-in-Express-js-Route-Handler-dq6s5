# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The buggy code attempts to find a user based on an ID passed as a route parameter. It directly parses the ID as an integer without verifying if the parameter is a valid number or if a user with that ID exists.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is invalid.

## Solution

The corrected code in `bugSolution.js` includes comprehensive error handling:

1.  It checks if the `userId` parameter is a valid integer.
2.  It handles the case where no user is found with the given ID.
3.  It provides appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate errors.

This improved error handling makes the application more robust and secure.
